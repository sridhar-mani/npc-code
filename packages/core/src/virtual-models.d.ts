/**
 * Virtual models are catalog entries that route each request to a physical model.
 *
 * The selection (`model_change`, `agent.state.model`, `ctx.model`) may name a virtual model.
 * Everything below the routing step only sees physical models: providers stream them and
 * assistant messages record them. A virtual model never reaches a provider.
 *
 * Virtual models belong to a provider id but are not provider models. `ModelRuntime` keeps them
 * separately and adds them to the provider's catalog with `withVirtualModels()`, so any provider,
 * including one with physical models, can list several virtual models.
